# logical-clock
A webapp to calculate the lamport-clock and the vector-clock of a system

## Project purpose

This is a web-app that is used to create charts representing multi-process systems and calculate the **locical clock** in the form of **lamport clock** or **vector clock**. It was used during the exam at TUM "Distributed Systems" and, hence, the current frontend implementation is more a proof of concept and the frontend leaves much to be desired.
